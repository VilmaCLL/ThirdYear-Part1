# ThirdYear-Part1
Priority Queue. Manually designed double-linked list.

The assignment asks to design a system for an immigration office through which arrivals, order on queue and searches can be done. Priority on queue due to different conditions also applyed.
So far my most organised project. 
Very proud!
